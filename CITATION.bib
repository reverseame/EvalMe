abstract="With the constant growth of IoT devices, software performance and memory usage have become relevant aspects when choosing the most suitable and optimal configuration of these resource-constrained devices. Moreover, in certain scenarios security must be guaranteed to protect data confidentiality, which imposes another resource consumption overhead. In this work-in-progress we evaluate the resource consumption of two widely-used block ciphers (AES and 3DES) and stream ciphers (Salsa20 and Chacha20), implemented in two C++ libraries (Crypto++ and Botan), to find out which library and algorithms are the most efficient for such devices. In addition, we also evaluate whether the type of input data affects the resource consumption. Our results show that the memory consumption is similar across both libraries and algorithms. In terms of CPU, Crypto++ outperforms Botan, with ChaCha20 achieving the best performance rates. Regarding the type of input data, no major impact has been noticed.",
